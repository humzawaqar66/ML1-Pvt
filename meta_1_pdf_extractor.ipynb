All statements contained in this Annual \\nReport on Form 10-K other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations \\nand financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking \\nstatements. The words \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" and similar \\nexpressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on \\nour current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, \\nresults of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. \\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described \\nin Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and \\nrapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, \\nnor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may \\ncause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of \\nthese risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may \\nnot occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking \\nstatements.\\nWe undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, \\nexcept as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such \\nforward-looking statements. \\nIn October 2021, we changed our corporate name from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms, Inc. We will not distinguish \\nbetween our prior and current corporate name and will refer to our current corporate name throughout this Annual Report on \\nForm 10-K. As such, unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms \"Meta,\" \"company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \\nand \"our\" in this document refer to Meta Platforms, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The \\nterm \"Family\" refers to our Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp products. For references to accessing Meta\\'s \\nproducts on the \"web\" or via a \"website,\" such terms refer to accessing such products on personal computers. For references \\nto accessing Meta\\'s products on \"mobile,\" such term refers to accessing such products via a mobile application or via a \\nmobile-optimized version of our websites such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet.\\n3', 'LIMITATIONS OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER DATA\\nThe numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We \\nhave historically reported the numbers of our daily active users (DAUs), monthly active users (MAUs), and average revenue \\nper user (ARPU) (collectively, our \"Facebook metrics\") based on user activity only on Facebook and Messenger and not on \\nour other products. Beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, we also report \\nour estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP), monthly active people (MAP), and average revenue per \\nperson (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, \\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement. \\nWe believe our Family metrics better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one \\nof our products. As a result, over time we intend to report our Family metrics as key metrics in place of DAUs, MAUs, and \\nARPU in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable \\nperiod of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile \\npopulations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also \\nsusceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user \\nbase, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our \\nprocesses for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to \\nimprove their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical \\nmetrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such \\nadjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or \\nadjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties \\ndue to differences in methodology.\\nFamily Metrics\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple \\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of \\nuser accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our \\nFamily metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, \\nand WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our \\nFamily, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To \\ncalculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the \\nindividual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across \\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one \\nperson. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, \\nand inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics \\nprimarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family \\nmetrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide \\nMAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and \\nit is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, \\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes \\nor trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are \\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply \\nsignificant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within \\nindividual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and \\nuser names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our \\nproducts, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and \\nmay in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations \\nmay affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. \\nOur techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals \\n4', 'for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer \\ndata signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp \\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our Family \\nmetrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and \\nMAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own \\nproduct decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations \\nwhile our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or \\naccuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics \\nalso may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product \\nchanges, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match \\naccounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution \\nmay allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\" \\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our \\nterms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that approximately 3% of our \\nworldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of \\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and \\nbehaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have \\nlimited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or \\nmore violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have \\none account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product \\nchanges, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP \\nand MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely \\nof violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that \\nthe actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\\nThe numbers of Family DAP and MAP discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPP, do not \\ninclude users on our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other \\nactivities on our Family products.\\nFacebook Metrics\\nWe regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among our \\nMAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide \"false\" accounts \\ninto two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for a business, organization, \\nor non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal profile under \\nour terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for \\npurposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on \\nan internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For \\nexample, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to \\nidentify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. \\nAny loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\\nparty browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely \\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and \\nfalse accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data \\nsignals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and \\nmay improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to \\nmeasure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our \\nestimates.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our \\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the \\nPhilippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that false \\naccounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can vary as a \\nresult of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries \\n5', \"such as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take \\nother actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and \\nMAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts \\namong our MAUs on an annual basis.\\nThe numbers of DAUs and MAUs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPU, do not include \\nusers on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, \\nbased on their other activities on Facebook.\\nUser Geography\\nOur data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP \\naddress and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a \\nuser may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the \\nuser's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical \\nerrors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors. \\n6\", \"PART I\\nItem 1. Business  \\nOverview\\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. All of our products, \\nincluding our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\\nWe build technology that helps people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. Our useful and engaging \\nproducts enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual \\nreality (VR) headsets, wearables, and in-home devices. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the \\nworld around them, enable people to share their opinions, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with audiences \\nranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our \\nproducts. Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build \\nthe metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social technology.\\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). For FoA, we generate \\nsubstantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers. Ads on our platforms enable marketers to \\nreach people based on a variety of factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors. Marketers purchase ads \\nthat can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. \\nRL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software and content. Our products include: \\nFamily of Apps\\n• Facebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a\\nplace for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover\\nand connect to interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through News Feed, Stories, Groups,\\nWatch, Marketplace, Reels, Dating, and more.\\n• Instagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels,\\nVideo, Live, Shops, and messaging are places where people and creators can express themselves and push\\nculture forward through photos, video, and private messaging, and connect with and shop from their favorite\\nbusinesses.\\n• Messenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family,\\ngroups, and businesses across platforms and devices through chat, audio and video calls, and Rooms.\\n• WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and\\nbusinesses around the world to communicate and transact in a private way.\\nReality Labs\\n• Reality Labs. Reality Labs' augmented and virtual reality products help people feel connected, anytime,\\nanywhere. Meta Quest lets people defy distance with cutting-edge VR hardware, software, and content. Facebook\\nPortal video calling devices help friends and families stay connected and share the moments that matter in\\nmeaningful ways.\\nCompetition\\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies \\nproviding connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that \\nsell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing \\nadvertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, \\ncompanies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable \\nmarketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for example, Alphabet (Google and YouTube), \\n7\", \"Amazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft, Snap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter. We compete to attract, \\nengage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and \\nadvertising services, and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with \\nour products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented \\nreality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other \\ncompanies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse, we may become \\nsubject to additional competition. \\nTechnology\\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are \\nsocial by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the \\nproduct experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video and VR increases, and as we deepen our \\ninvestment in new technologies like artificial intelligence, our computing needs continue to expand. We make significant \\ninvestments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our \\nmarketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing \\nin both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse. \\nSales and Operations \\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We \\nalso have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout \\nthe stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. \\nWe work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers. We operate in more than \\n80 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to \\nprovide direct customer support to our users and partners.\\nMarketing\\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with \\nthem, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to \\ninvest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world. \\nIntellectual Property \\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade \\nsecrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, \\nemployee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to further protect our \\nproprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. We do not believe \\nthat our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We \\nbelieve the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.\\nGovernment Regulation \\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our \\nbusiness, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our \\nbusiness. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, \\nbiometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, \\ndata retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other \\ncommunications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications, product liability, \\ne-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance,\\nsecurities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws\\nregarding privacy and protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer\\nprotection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations, or penalties or fines for non-compliance, or be\\nmore restrictive than those in the United States.\\n8\", \"These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties \\nin addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the \\napplication, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and \\nrapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and \\ninconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in \\nwhich we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made \\navailable on our products, could adversely affect our financial results. In the United States, there have been, and continue to \\nbe, various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the \\nCommunications Decency Act, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, \\nbusiness practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can \\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or \\nregions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to transfer data between and \\namong countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, \\nit could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, \\nwhich could adversely affect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for \\ndata transferred from the European Union to the United States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the \\nEuropean Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard \\nContractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. In August 2020, we received a \\npreliminary draft decision from the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Meta \\nPlatforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the General Data \\nProtection Regulation (GDPR) and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the \\nUnited States should therefore be suspended. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first half of \\n2022. If a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely \\nupon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of \\nour most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and \\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new \\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business. For example, the GDPR includes operational requirements \\nfor companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those \\npreviously in place in the European Union, requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European \\nUnion privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as \\nwell as other requirements of the regulation. The GDPR is still a relatively new law, its interpretation is still evolving, and \\ndraft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the \\nGDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a \\nresult, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-\\ncompliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted \\nsimilar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in \\ntheir respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, and its successor, the \\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, which will take effect in January 2023, also establish certain transparency rules and create new \\ndata privacy rights for users. In addition, effective December 2020, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive includes \\nadditional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. \\nChanges to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments may adversely affect our \\nadvertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both \\nthe federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our \\nbusiness. For example, the proposed Digital Markets Act in the European Union and pending proposals to modify \\ncompetition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costs and could \\npotentially impose new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of \\ndata across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. In addition, some countries, such as India, are considering \\nor have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or \\nsimilar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. New legislation or regulatory \\ndecisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising \\nservices or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\\n9\", 'We are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, \\nactions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly \\nin the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, and \\ncompetition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to \\nregulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade \\nCommission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other matters, requires us to maintain a comprehensive \\nprivacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities \\ncould cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including \\nsubstantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our \\nbusiness, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from \\nour business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" \\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \\nHuman Capital\\nAt Meta, we design products to bring the world closer together, one connection at a time. As a company, we believe \\nthat people are at the heart of every connection we build. We are proud of our unique company culture where ideas, \\ninnovation, and impact win, and we work hard to build strong teams across engineering, product design, marketing, and other \\nareas to further our mission. \\nWe had a global workforce of 71,970 employees as of December 31, 2021, which represents a 23% year-over-year \\nincrease in employee headcount. We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we \\ncontinue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a number of \\nemployees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives as well as \\nother functions to support our expected growth. \\nOur headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California and we have offices in more than 80 cities around the globe. \\nThe vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the long \\nterm, we expect some personnel to continue to transition to working remotely on a regular basis. We offer most of our full-\\ntime employees the option to work remotely on a regular basis.\\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\\nDiversity, equity and inclusion are core to our work at Meta. We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where \\nwe can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global \\ncommunity we serve. While we have made progress, we still have more work to do.\\nAs part of our diversity and inclusion report, we publish our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity \\nworkforce data annually. As of June 30, 2021, our global employee base was comprised of 36.7% females and 63.3% males, \\nand our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 45.7% Asian, 39.1% White, 6.5% Hispanic, \\n4.4% Black, 3.9% two or more ethnicities, and 0.4% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native and \\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). In recent years, we also announced our goals to have 50% of our workforce made \\nup of underrepresented groups by 2024, and to increase the representation of people of color in leadership positions in the \\nUnited States, including Black leadership, by 30% from 2020 to 2025. We will also continue our ongoing efforts to increase \\nthe representation of women in leadership.\\nWe work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through recruiting, retention, people development, and \\ninclusion. We employ our Diverse Slate Approach in our global recruitment efforts, which ensures that teams and hiring \\nmanagers have the opportunity to consider qualified people from underrepresented groups for open roles. We have seen \\nsteady increases in hiring rates of people from underrepresented groups since we started testing this approach in 2015. We \\nalso continue to develop inclusive internship programs, and Meta University, our training program for college freshmen and \\nsophomores with an interest in Computer Science, also utilizes a proactive and inclusive approach to promote participation by \\npeople from underrepresented groups. To help build community among our people and support their professional \\ndevelopment, we invest in our internal Meta Resource Groups and our annual Community events such as Women\\'s \\n10', 'Community Summit, Black Community Summit, Latin Community Summit, and Pride Community Summit. We also offer \\nManaging Unconscious Bias, Managing Inclusion, Be the Ally, and other trainings to promote an inclusive workplace by \\nhelping people understand the issues that affect underrepresented communities and how to reduce the effects of bias in the \\nworkplace.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can \\nfocus on our mission. Our employees\\' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales \\nincentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual equity grants \\nbecause we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have conducted pay equity \\nanalyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2021, we announced that our analyses indicate that \\nwe continue to have pay equity across genders globally and race in the United States for people in similar jobs, accounting for \\nfactors such as location, role, and level.\\nThrough Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their loved ones with resources \\nto help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and time \\naway, including healthcare and wellness benefits, family building benefits, family care resources, retirement savings plans, \\naccess to tax and legal services, Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta, family leave, and paid time off.\\nCorporate Information\\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

These \\nrisks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to: \\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\\n• our ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\\n• the loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\\n• reduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\\n• ineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\\npartners;\\n• failure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\\n• the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;\\n• our ability to compete effectively;\\n• unfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\\n• volatile or slower user and revenue growth rates in the future;\\n• acquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\\n• our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our\\nservice;\\n• operating our business in multiple countries around the world;\\n• litigation, including class action lawsuits;\\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\\n• government restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to sell\\nadvertising, in their countries;\\n• complex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer\\nprotection, and other laws and regulations;\\n12', \"• the impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and\\ninvestigations by privacy and competition authorities;\\n• our ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the\\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC);\\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\\n• the occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber\\nincidents or undesirable activity on our platform;\\n• our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\\n• limitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual\\nclass structure of our common stock and the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital\\nstock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.\\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, \\nour revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\\nThe size of our user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our success. Our \\nfinancial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and \\nengaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We anticipate that \\nour active user growth rate will continue to generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases. In \\naddition, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user \\nbase in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User \\ngrowth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as \\nTikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, as well as global and regional business \\nand macroeconomic conditions. For example, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in \\nthe size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More \\nrecently, we have seen these pandemic-related trends subside. We are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user \\ngrowth and engagement with any certainty, and these trends may continue to be subject to volatility. In the fourth quarter of \\n2021, we experienced a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the total number of DAUs on Facebook, as well as a \\nslight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of DAUs on Facebook in the United States & Canada region. Any \\nfuture declines in the size of our active user base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our \\nfinancial performance.\\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain \\nusers or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking \\ncompanies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some \\ncases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement \\nlevels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly \\nas we introduce new and different products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, \\nand engagement, including if:\\n• users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\\n• we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or\\nservices, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\\n• users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency,\\n13\", \"prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;\\n• users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of\\nactions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\\n• user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on\\nour products and services;\\n• we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety\\nof mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\\n• there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data\\npractices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to privacy,\\nsafety, security, well-being, or other factors;\\n• we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate,\\ninteresting, useful, and relevant to them;\\n• we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\\n• we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that\\nintegrate with our products;\\n• users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not\\nbe featured or otherwise available;\\n• there are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely affect\\nour products or users;\\n• we are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in\\nEurope, or are otherwise limited in our business operations, as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative\\nbodies determining that our reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legal bases we rely upon to\\ntransfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\\n• there is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of privacy-focused\\nchanges that we have implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with the\\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, the California Consumer\\nPrivacy Act (CCPA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;\\n• technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise\\naffect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;\\n• we adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or we take,\\nor fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public,\\nincluding as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board regarding content on\\nour platform;\\n• we elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth and\\nengagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult\\nexperience in the long term);\\n• we make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;\\n• initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result\\nof actions by us, third parties, or otherwise;\\n14\", '• third-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans, are\\nscaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;\\n• there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other\\nmobile applications in certain countries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the\\naccessibility of our products in their countries;\\n• we fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\\n• we, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry are\\nthe subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user data\\npractices; or\\n• our current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable\\ndevelopers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity on our products by\\nmaking it easier for our users to interact and share on third-party mobile and web applications.\\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying \\ndegrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-\\ngenerating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected. Any \\nsignificant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, marketers, and \\ndevelopers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, \\nour revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. As our active user growth rate continues to slow, we will \\nbecome increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to \\ndrive revenue growth.\\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by \\nmarketers, could seriously harm our business.\\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is \\ncommon in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers \\nspend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to do business \\nwith us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, if \\nthey do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, \\nor if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our \\nuser data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely \\naffected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable \\nreturn on investment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results \\nmay be harmed.\\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\\n• decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\\n• our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\\n• product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or\\nrelative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our\\nproducts;\\n• our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\\n• our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\\n• changes to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising,\\nincluding changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\\n15', \"• adverse government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including\\ndevelopments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\\n• user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize, such\\nas our feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or messaging\\nproducts;\\n• reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the\\nsecurity and integrity of our platform;\\n• the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties\\nthat demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\\n• loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors\\noffer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;\\n• limitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and\\nInstagram, in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on\\nSCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\\n• changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks\\nrelated to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\\n• decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or\\nother negative publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our\\nproducts, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products\\n(including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with\\nmobile and web applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;\\n• reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third parties,\\nquestions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or potential legal\\nliability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations (for example, a number of marketers\\nannounced that they paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content on our products);\\n• the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt in or out of the use of data for ads, including as a\\nresult of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with\\nthe GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), other laws, regulations, regulatory\\nactions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes;\\n• the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\\n• changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\\n• the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\\n• changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\\n• the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among\\nspecific types of marketers or within particular geographies.\\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The \\noccurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce \\nthe prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, either of which would negatively \\naffect our revenue and financial results. For example, macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, \\nmarketers' ability or willingness to spend with us, as we experienced in 2020 with the regional and worldwide economic \\n16\", \"disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated declines in advertising activity on our products. The effects of \\nthe pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our ads, a related decline in pricing of our ads, and additional \\ndemands on our technical infrastructure as a result of increased usage of our services, and any similar occurrences in the \\nfuture may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users and adversely affect our \\nrevenue and financial results.\\nOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity \\non websites and services that we do not control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating \\nsystems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, the availability of such \\nsignals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\\nWe rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant \\nand effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate \\nthese signals, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. For example, legislative \\nand regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue \\nto impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen an increasing number of users opt to \\ncontrol certain types of ad targeting in Europe following adoption of the GDPR, which will increase further with expanded \\ncontrol over certain third-party data as part of our ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes \\nthat limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance or decisions or \\nnew legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that \\nfurther reduce our ability to use these signals. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and \\nGoogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application \\ndevelopers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain \\nchanges to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other \\niOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to \\nnegatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, \\nwe have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such \\ndata signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and \\nour worldwide offering of certain product changes we implemented in connection with the GDPR. These developments have \\nlimited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising \\nrevenue. For example, our advertising revenue in the second half of 2021 was negatively impacted by marketer reaction to \\ntargeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they \\ntake further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which \\nwould in turn significantly impact our future advertising revenue growth.\\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating \\nsystems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that \\npopular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products \\nrather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating \\nsystems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating \\nsystems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with \\nmobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service \\nor policies that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give \\npreferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or \\ncharge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of our products \\nand monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the \\nuse of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, \\nand also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively. We expect that any similar \\nchanges to its, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the \\neffectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important \\nthat our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not \\ncontrol, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers. We may \\nnot be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing \\nproducts that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is \\n17\", \"more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use \\nour products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user \\nengagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the \\noperation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect \\nour users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, \\nbrowser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the \\nanticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with \\nsuch third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business \\ncould be harmed. We have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, \\ntechnologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact \\nour user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our \\nbusiness and financial results.\\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits.\\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to \\ncontinue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with \\ndevelopers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new \\nand unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating \\nexperience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented \\nreality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and \\ntechnologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with \\nthese efforts. In addition, the introduction of new products, or changes to existing products, may result in new or enhanced \\ngovernmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial \\nresults. We have also invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our WhatsApp and \\nMessenger products to support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a \\nlimited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over \\nthe long term. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging \\nservices, as well as facilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which plans have drawn governmental and \\nregulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our new or enhanced products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, \\nor if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating \\nmargin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the \\nlong-term benefits that we expect.\\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe \\nthat the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our \\nfinancial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to \\nour user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely \\naffected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables \\nusers to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which \\nreduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our \\nNews Feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the \\neffect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our \\nfinancial results. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product \\nand monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products \\nwhich may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their \\nincentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, \\nor introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more \\nproven means of monetization, such as our feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across \\nour family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or \\nmore products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as \\nquickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as our feed \\nor Stories products. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the \\nlong-term benefits that we expect.\\n18\", \"We may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, \\nreputation, or financial results.\\nWe believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional \\nscreens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to \\nfocus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will \\ninvolve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in privacy, safety, and security efforts, and \\ncollaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in \\naccordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is \\nuncertain. In addition, we have limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality \\ntechnology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research \\nand product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or \\ndevelop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Our \\nmetaverse efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to \\ncontinue to make significant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and \\nour ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, \\nas our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States \\nand international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the \\ndevelopment of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or \\notherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse strategy and investments may not be \\nsuccessful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and developers \\nmay be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.\\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that \\nmaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new \\nusers are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to \\nprovide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new \\nproducts or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the \\nactions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party \\nmobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We \\nwill also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, \\ndata use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions or \\ndecisions in connection with elections or the COVID-19 pandemic, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the \\nfuture adversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of \\nmedia, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of internal company \\ndocuments relating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, \\nas well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In addition, in March 2018, we \\nannounced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in \\nviolation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable \\ncontent on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or to otherwise enforce our policies or address \\nuser concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be \\nnegatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users \\nacting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to \\nbe misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user \\ninformation for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services \\nfor illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the United \\nStates and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent \\nOversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user \\nwell-being, or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our \\ncommunity standards or terms of service. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial \\ninvestments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding \\ndeveloper misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other \\ncontent, as well as user well-being issues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we \\n19\", 'fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and \\nfinancial results may be adversely affected.\\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web \\napplications that integrate with Facebook and our other products.\\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and \\nweb applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be \\nsuccessful in building, growing, or monetizing mobile and/or web applications that create and maintain user engagement. \\nAdditionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled by third parties, \\nrather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We are continuously seeking to balance the \\ndistribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful \\nin achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken \\nactions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on Facebook and our other products with the \\nobjective of enhancing the user experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our \\nmonetization opportunities from, mobile and web applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts \\nrelated to privacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and \\nwe also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these \\nactions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or will adversely \\naffect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers \\nthat choose to build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and \\nmaintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be \\nadversely affected.\\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has previously had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our advertising \\nrevenue and also exposes our business to other risks.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures from time to time \\nto contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, \\nquarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or \\nshutdowns in certain affected countries and regions, which have previously significantly impacted our business and results of \\noperations. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, our advertising revenue grew 10% year-over-year, which was the \\nslowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public offering. While our advertising revenue growth rate \\nimproved in subsequent quarters, there can be no assurance that it will not decrease again as a result of the effects of the \\npandemic. In addition, we believe that the pandemic previously contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online \\ncommerce, which in turn increased demand for our advertising services. More recently, we believe this growth has moderated \\nin many regions, and we may experience reduced advertising demand and related declines in pricing in future periods to the \\nextent this trend continues, which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. The demand for and pricing of our \\nadvertising services may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future, and we are unable \\nto predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty. In addition to the impact on our advertising business, the \\npandemic exposes our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including:\\n• volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as a\\nresult of shelter-in-place measures or other factors;\\n• delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer\\nhardware, as a result of inventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages;\\n• increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising practices\\nor other activity inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or objectionable\\nmaterial on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity;\\n20', '• adverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of limitations\\non our safety, security, and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as the necessity to\\nrely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that our workforce is unable to perform;\\n• significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange\\nrates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future;\\n• negative impact on our workforce productivity, product development, and research and development due to\\ndifficulties resulting from our personnel working remotely;\\n• illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies, delays, and\\ndisruptions in our business; and\\n• increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial\\nstatements.\\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory \\nactions against us. The persistence of COVID-19, and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the \\nillness, have impacted, and will continue to impact, our ability to operate our business and may materially and adversely \\nimpact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to \\nusers online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and \\nsystems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, \\nincluding, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and \\ninformation online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for example, Alphabet \\n(Google and YouTube), Amazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft, Snap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter. \\nWe compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or \\npaid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling mobile and web \\napplications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware \\nand virtual and augmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products \\nevolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse, we \\nmay become subject to additional competition.\\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive \\npositions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our \\ncompetitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to \\ncompete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or \\nemerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware \\nof and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we \\nbelieve that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other \\nproducts and services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a \\ndecline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be \\nharmed.\\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, \\nmay undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more \\naggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate, \\nincluding: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads; by imposing \\nfees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making \\nit more difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products \\nthey control such as mobile device operating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each \\nof Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has \\nreleased changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and \\n21', \"measure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate \\nadvertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial \\nresults. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we cannot assure you that \\nthese actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.\\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, \\nincluding:\\n• the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors'\\nproducts;\\n• the size and composition of our user base;\\n• the engagement of users with our products and competing products;\\n• our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\\n• the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors'\\nproducts;\\n• our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;\\n• our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\\n• our ability to monetize our products;\\n• the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\\n• customer service and support efforts;\\n• marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers\\nwith a compelling return on their investments;\\n• our ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with\\nFacebook and our other products;\\n• our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other\\nproducts;\\n• changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate\\neffect on us;\\n• acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\\n• our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product\\nmanagers;\\n• our ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\\n• our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad impressions\\nmay decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be \\nmaterially and adversely affected.\\n22\", 'Unfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.\\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our \\nprivacy practices, advertising policies, product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government \\nsurveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the \\nuse of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our community standards, \\nterms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the \\nperceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, or the actions of other companies that provide \\nsimilar services to ours, has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been \\nthe subject of significant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate \\nspeech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these \\ntopics. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the \\nrelease of internal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to \\nnegative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our products or \\nservices, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and elections in the United States and around the world. Any \\nsuch negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer \\ndemand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and \\nfinancial results, and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a \\nlimited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a \\nresult, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance. You should take into \\naccount the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in \\nany given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our \\ncontrol, including:\\n• our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad\\nimpressions;\\n• our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\\n• our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period, including as a result of\\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n• fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth\\nquarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;\\n• the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\\n• the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\\n• changes to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising,\\nincluding changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\\n• the pricing of our ads and other products;\\n• the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\\n• our ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we\\nmay introduce in the future;\\n• changes to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or\\nour competitors;\\n23', '• user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\\n• increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and\\nto remain competitive, including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;\\n• costs related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing\\nchanges to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or decisions\\nor recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or otherwise;\\n• costs and expenses related to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\\n• our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\\n• costs related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the\\nacquired technologies;\\n• charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet;\\n• our ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a\\ntimely and cost-effective manner;\\n• system failures or outages or government blocking, which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time;\\n• breaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;\\n• changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party\\nactions;\\n• fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;\\n• refunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;\\n• share-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;\\n• adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\\n• changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, data protection, and content,\\nor actions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\\n• the overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in jurisdictions\\nwith different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating intellectual property from\\nacquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of discrete items such as legal and tax\\nsettlements and tax elections;\\n• the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the\\nperiod such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that\\nperiod;\\n• tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently\\nunder by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in\\nforeign currencies;\\n• trading activity in our share repurchase program;\\n24', \"• fluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our equity\\ninvestments, and in interest rates;\\n• changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\\n• changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19\\npandemic, which may impact the other factors described above.\\nOur rates of growth may be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect they will \\ndecline over time in the future.\\nWe have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, volatility in our user and revenue growth rates as a \\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility with any \\ncertainty. In the long term, we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user \\nbase increases, and the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets, particularly as we \\nachieve greater market penetration. We also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our revenue \\nincreases to higher levels. As our growth rates experience volatility or decline, investors' perceptions of our business may be \\nadversely affected and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\\nOur costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and augmented \\nreality, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-\\nterm, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\\nOperating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our \\nuser base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with \\nrespect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new and existing products and promote our \\nbrands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and unproven technologies, and \\nas we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding operations, including our efforts to \\nfocus on privacy, safety, security, and content review. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments, \\nfines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our business. \\nWe are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including as we continue our efforts \\nrelated to building the metaverse. Some of these investments, particularly our significant investments in virtual and \\naugmented reality, have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect \\nthe adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, our investments in \\nReality Labs reduced our 2021 overall operating profit by approximately $10 billion, and we expect our investments to \\nincrease in future periods. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be \\nharmed.\\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial \\ncondition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized \\nemployees and complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic \\ntransactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may \\nnot be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or at all, including as a result of \\nregulatory challenges. For example, in 2021, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority issued an order \\ndirecting us to divest our Giphy acquisition, which we have appealed. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other \\nstrategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will realize expected synergies from future growth \\nand potential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategic \\ninvestments.\\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which has \\noccurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased \\nfixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our \\nability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant RSUs to \\nretain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and \\n25\", 'result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be \\nviewed negatively by users, marketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our \\nClass A common stock.\\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that \\nwere not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence \\nreview and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of \\nstatements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well as the limited \\namount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an \\nacquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions \\nmay also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial \\nfinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial \\ncondition or results of operations.\\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the \\ncompanies we acquire.\\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have \\nsignificant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not manage these \\nprocesses successfully. We continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which has in \\nthe past resulted, and we expect will in the future result, in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of \\nresources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be \\nsuccessful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the \\ntransaction and our business may be harmed.\\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption \\nin our service, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of \\nusers and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our \\nproducts and our underlying technical infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, \\ninterruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time. Our systems may not be adequately \\ndesigned or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages that could \\nbe harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as \\nquickly as expected, users may not use our products as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be \\ndisrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. We have experienced such issues to \\nvarying degrees from time to time. For example, in October 2021, a combination of an error and a bug resulted in an \\napproximately six-hour outage of our services. In addition, as the amount and types of information shared on our products \\ncontinue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal \\noperational demands continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network \\ncapacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale \\nand grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user \\nengagement and advertising revenue growth. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures \\nresulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, \\nother physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. Global climate change could result in certain types \\nof natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may result in users being subject \\nto service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely \\nmanner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results. We also have been, and may in the \\nfuture be, subject to increased energy or other costs to maintain the availability or performance of our products in connection \\nwith any such events.\\nIn 2020, the increase in the use of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demands on our \\ntechnical infrastructure. We may not be able to accommodate any such demands in the future, including as a result of our \\nreduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic.\\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services \\n26', 'we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm \\nour business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little \\ncontrol over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. Due to the effects \\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, supply and labor shortages and other \\ndisruptions in logistics and the supply chain for our technical infrastructure. As a result, we have had to make certain changes \\nto our procurement practices, and in the future we may not be able to procure sufficient components, equipment, or services \\nfrom third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be required to procure such components, equipment, or services on \\nunfavorable terms. \\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require \\nunfavorable changes to existing products, delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect our business \\nand financial results. \\nWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we \\nserve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data \\ncenters, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is \\ncomplex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in emerging markets that expose us to \\nincreased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges, among others. We have in the past suspended, \\nand may in the future suspend, certain of these projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional unanticipated \\ndelays or disruptions in the completion of these projects, including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions \\nof such projects, or availability of components, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other \\ngeopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or otherwise, may lead \\nto increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of \\nour products, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that \\nare not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have \\nstarted to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. Further, \\nmuch of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and it is possible that action by a foreign \\ngovernment, or our response to such government action, could result in the impairment of a portion of our technical \\ninfrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative \\nuser experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our \\nbusiness.\\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person \\n(ARPP)) and Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), are calculated using internal \\ncompany data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable \\nestimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our \\nproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics \\nrequire significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually \\nseeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our \\nmethodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover \\ninaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical \\nmetrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to \\napply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family \\nmetrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below. \\nIn addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties \\ndue to differences in methodology.\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple \\nuser accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of \\nuser accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our \\nFamily metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, \\n27', 'and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our \\nFamily, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To \\ncalculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the \\nindividual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across \\nmultiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one \\nperson. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, \\nand inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics \\nprimarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family \\nmetrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide \\nMAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and \\nit is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, \\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes \\nor trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are \\ndeveloped based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply \\nsignificant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within \\nindividual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and \\nuser names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our \\nproducts, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and \\nmay in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations \\nmay affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. \\nOur techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals \\nfor some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer \\ndata signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp \\nuser accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our Family \\nmetrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and \\nMAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own \\nproduct decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations \\nwhile our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or \\naccuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics \\nalso may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product \\nchanges, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match \\naccounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution \\nmay allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\" \\naccounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our \\nterms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that approximately 3% of our \\nworldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of \\naccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and \\nbehaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have \\nlimited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or \\nmore violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have \\none account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product \\nchanges, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP \\nand MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely \\nof violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that \\nthe actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\\nWe also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among \\nour MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide \"false\" \\naccounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for a business, \\norganization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal \\nprofile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to \\nbe used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts \\n28', \"are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this \\ndetermination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user \\nnames, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to \\nthe reviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, \\nactions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel \\nwork remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of \\nduplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application \\nof new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false \\naccounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very \\ndifficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary \\nsignificantly from our estimates.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our \\nworldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the \\nPhilippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that false \\naccounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can vary as a \\nresult of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries \\nsuch as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take \\nother actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and \\nMAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts \\namong our MAUs on an annual basis.\\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-\\nprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate \\nnumber of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not \\nbe complete.\\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as \\nthe user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. \\nFor example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to \\nrather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm \\nor other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these \\nfactors. \\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to \\nthe reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics \\nand estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human error. Such metrics and estimates also \\nchange from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology or methodology, including as a result of loss of \\naccess to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, \\nsubject to litigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. \\nWhere marketers, developers, or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover \\nmaterial inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers \\nand developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions, which \\ncould negatively affect our business and financial results.\\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.\\nOur employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number \\nof employees increasing to 71,970 as of December 31, 2021 from 58,604 as of December 31, 2020, and we expect headcount \\ngrowth to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors \\nto continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives as well as other functions to support our \\nexpected growth. The growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management, \\noperational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other \\nthird parties. As our operations and the number of our third-party relationships continue to grow, our information technology \\nsystems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support such growth. In addition, some members of \\nour management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not \\n29\", 'be able to manage such growth effectively. Additionally, the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as \\na result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact \\nproductivity. In the long term, we may experience such challenges to productivity and collaboration as some personnel \\ntransition to working remotely on a regular basis, and we may experience difficulties integrating recently hired personnel \\nwhen our offices re-open. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to adapt to a remote work environment; \\nimprove our operational, financial, and management processes and systems; and effectively expand, train, and manage our \\npersonnel. As our organization continues to grow, and we are required to implement more complex organizational \\nmanagement structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our \\nability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.\\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more \\nlimited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our \\nfinancial results.\\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business \\noperations and the translation of our products. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different languages, \\nand we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. We may enter new international markets where we \\nhave limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available \\nglobally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory \\ncomplexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available in China. We also outsource certain operational \\nfunctions to third-party vendors globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, \\nour business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\\n• political, social, or economic instability;\\n• risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and\\noperations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade\\ncompliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety,\\nlicensing, and infrastructure matters;\\n• potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or\\nrequirements to provide user information to local authorities;\\n• enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different\\nlanguages and countries;\\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\\n• foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash\\nearned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our\\nability to invest such cash efficiently;\\n• higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\\n• enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\\n• burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content\\nmoderation, data localization, data protection, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;\\n• reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\\n• difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal\\ncompliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from personnel\\nworking remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n• compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\\n30', \"• geopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes and pandemics.\\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given\\njurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations applicable \\nto us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage our obligations to \\ncomply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and sanctions, including \\nregulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a broad \\nrange of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of anti-corruption laws or \\nregulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and other laws, rules, and regulations.\\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our \\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our operations or the \\noffering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks described above, which could \\nadversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.\\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our \\nfinancial results.\\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our \\nconsumer hardware products. For example, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the \\nfuture may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products, or from the software used in the \\nproducts. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. Our \\nbrand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers' \\nexpectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer \\nhardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics and the \\nsupply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. \\nWe could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on \\nreasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties, \\nmanufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such \\narrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be \\nnegatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments \\nthat subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain disruptions.\\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and \\ncertain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor, health and safety, the environment, and \\nbusiness ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If any of them violates laws, fails to implement \\nchanges in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-\\ncompliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our \\nreputation.\\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in \\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand and \\nconsumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products, and other factors. \\nThe demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the \\ndate of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer \\nhardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the \\nconsumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product \\nor enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or \\ncomponent selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may \\nrequire significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely \\n31\", \"affect our operating results.\\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, \\nand, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits, \\nmany of which claim statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we \\nwill continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer \\nbase, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged per-\\nuser or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to additional \\nclass action lawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, biometrics, content, algorithms, employment, \\nactivities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer \\nhardware and software, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are \\ncurrently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the \\nmisuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the \\ndisclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as \\nother alleged anticompetitive conduct; and a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents \\nbeginning in September 2021. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any \\nnegative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable \\nchanges to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could \\nbe materially and adversely affected.\\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit \\nis costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may \\nresult in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary \\ndamages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which has occurred in the past and \\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and \\nintercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use \\nour intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, \\nincluding the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are \\naggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We \\nare subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with \\ncertain positions we have taken, including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany \\narrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase \\nthe amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash \\nflows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign \\nsubsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's \\nposition and are litigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may \\nadversely affect our financial results.\\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment \\nby management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income \\ntaxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to \\nsuch operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of \\nour non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial \\nstatements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, \\nchanges in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or \\naccounting principles.\\n32\", 'Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be \\nsubject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could \\nmaterially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \\n(Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth \\nquarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or \\nCongressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact \\nour effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many \\ncountries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could \\nsignificantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in \\nwhich we operate our business.\\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base \\nErosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under \\nwhich our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. In 2021, more than 140 countries \\ntentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions. As this framework is \\nsubject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such \\nchanges on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued \\nproposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals \\ninclude changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of \\nnon-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or \\nenacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, \\nand which apply to our business.\\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax \\nrulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that \\ncertain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in \\nchanges to the tax treatment of our foreign operations. \\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the \\ntaxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income \\ntaxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Such changes may also \\napply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our \\nfinancial statements.\\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from \\nperiod to period. In periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in \\nthat period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate. For example, in 2021, excess tax \\nbenefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $1.13 billion and our \\neffective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our \\nstock price is lower than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may \\nincrease. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also \\naffect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on \\nour stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate \\nand adversely affect our financial results.\\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value \\nmay not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment at the \\nreporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss \\nequal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. We may be \\nrequired to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill \\n33', 'or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the \\nfuture, could harm our business.\\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and \\nSheryl K. Sandberg. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, the \\nagreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. In addition, many of our key technologies and \\nsystems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members of management as \\nwell as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an \\nadverse effect on our business.\\nAs we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain \\nour competitive position. In particular, we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the \\nforeseeable future, and we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring such personnel, particularly for \\nengineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other companies or other factors. As we continue to mature, the \\nincentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as \\neffective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, \\nwe would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders \\nwould be further diluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price \\nvolatility. In addition, restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may \\nnegatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel . If we do not succeed in \\nattracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to \\ngrow effectively.\\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our \\noutstanding capital stock.\\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the \\nvoting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our \\nstockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all \\nof our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all \\nor substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the \\nconsummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also \\ndiscourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the \\nClass B common stock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the \\nability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and \\nhis ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of \\nour capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board \\nmember and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he \\nreasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, \\nMr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement, \\nin his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term \\nstockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish \\nour cash reserves.\\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the \\nprogram does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our \\nClass A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term \\nstockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a \\ntermination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish \\nour cash reserves.\\n34', 'Risks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or moderate \\ncontent on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their countries, could \\nsubstantially harm our business and financial results.\\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in \\ntheir country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other restrictions that may \\naffect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely. For example, user \\naccess to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and \\nNorth Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they \\nconsider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have \\nbeen restricted by governments in other countries from time to time. For example, in June 2020, Hong Kong adopted a \\nNational Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, \\nand suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In \\naddition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a \\nresult of the National Security Law, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. It is also possible that \\ngovernment authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising, including in countries where access to our \\nconsumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number \\nof resellers representing advertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese government could take action that \\nreduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in \\nresponse to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action \\nagainst us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are \\nfound to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish government \\ncould take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our \\nproducts. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is \\nrestricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other \\nrestrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or \\ncapture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to \\nretain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may \\nnot be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and \\ndata protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of these laws \\nand regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products \\nand business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or \\notherwise harm our business.\\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our \\nbusiness, including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, \\ncontent, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization \\nand storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of \\nminors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other \\ntrade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online \\npayment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that \\nwe may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, \\nprivacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be \\nmore restrictive than those in the United States.\\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties \\nin addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the \\napplication, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and \\nrapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and \\ninconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in \\nwhich we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and \\nengagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.\\n35', \"We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can \\ntransfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or \\nregions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the European Union \\nand United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called \\nthe Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union \\n(CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses \\n(SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a \\nbasis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data \\nProtection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on \\nSCCs will be the subject of future regulatory consideration. In particular, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft \\ndecision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European \\nuser data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the \\nEuropean Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Meta Platforms Ireland challenged procedural aspects of \\nthis IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020. In May 2021, the court rejected \\nMeta Platforms Ireland's procedural challenges and the inquiry subsequently recommenced. We believe a final decision in \\nthis inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022. If a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we \\nare unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United \\nStates, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and \\nInstagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of \\noperations. In addition, we have been managing investigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding \\nthe August 2016 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta \\nproducts and services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India, and also became subject to \\ngovernment inquiries and lawsuits regarding the 2021 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy. If we are \\nunable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing \\ndata among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our \\nservices or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new \\nlegislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number \\nof product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), \\nand may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach \\nnotifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance \\nwith the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The GDPR is still a relatively new law, its \\ninterpretation is still evolving, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European \\nprivacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome \\nof such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of \\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other \\ncountries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and \\nservices offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in \\nJanuary 2020, and its successor, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will take effect in January 2023, also \\nestablish certain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain \\nsensitive personal information and more ability for users to control how their data is shared with third parties. These laws and \\nregulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of \\nadvertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising \\nbusiness. For example, regulators continue to issue guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the \\nuse of cookies and similar technologies. In addition, effective December 2020, the ePrivacy Directive includes additional \\nlimitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to \\nour products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments may adversely affect our advertising business. \\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state \\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For \\nexample, the proposed Digital Markets Act in the European Union and pending proposals to modify competition laws in the \\nUnited States and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costs and could potentially impose new \\nrestrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, \\nmergers and acquisitions, and product design. In addition, some countries, such as India, are considering or have passed \\nlegislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar \\n36\", \"requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. New legislation or regulatory decisions \\nthat restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services \\nor our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.\\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government \\nactions, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, \\ndelays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating \\ncosts, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands or orders \\nthat we modify or cease existing business practices.\\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we \\nexpect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur \\nsubstantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business. \\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with \\nlaws and regulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the \\nsubject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, \\nand around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, \\ncontent moderation, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. In addition, we are currently, and \\nmay in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and \\nconsumer protection authorities in the European Union and other jurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or \\nadministrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other \\nauthorities may do the same. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and \\nother government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data \\npractices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms \\nand policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was \\napproved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to \\npay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. \\nThe state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. Beginning in \\nSeptember 2018, we also became subject to IDPC and other government inquiries in connection with a third-party cyber-\\nattack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from \\nuser accounts on Facebook. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain \\nother personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other \\nEuropean regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. \\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition \\nauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with \\nrespect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other \\nthings, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or \\nonline applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened \\nan antitrust investigation of our company. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of \\nantitrust inquiries and investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. Beginning in December \\n2020, we also became subject to lawsuits by the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the \\nDistrict of Columbia in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including \\nby acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other \\nthings. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged \\nviolations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. \\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure \\npractices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating \\nto allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee.\\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us \\nto incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary \\nremedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, result in \\nnegative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or \\nsubject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of \\n37\", 'these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, the ePrivacy Directive, and other regulatory and \\nlegislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and \\nany compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified \\nconsent order with the FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world, \\nsuch as the CCPA and the ePrivacy Directive. In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in \\nconnection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringent \\noperational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a \\nprocess to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy \\nprogram by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain \\nand enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require \\nsignificant new and ongoing investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical \\ninfrastructure. We are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, \\nan adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business \\npractices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a \\nresult, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will \\ncontinue to be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant \\ntime and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other \\nprivacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time to time we notify relevant \\nauthorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and \\nwe expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy \\nrequirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. If we are unable to \\nsuccessfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, or other \\nregulatory or legislative requirements, or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable \\nrequirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant \\nmonetary fines, judgments, or other penalties, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business \\npractices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our \\nproducts or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us \\nto change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is published or \\nmade available on our products, including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content. \\nIn particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation or news \\nhoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws \\nregulating hate speech or other types of content, online safety, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. \\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party \\nactions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in \\nApril 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for \\ncopyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which member states are currently implementing \\ninto their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply \\nto online video-sharing platforms, which member states are expected to implement by 2021. In the United States, there have \\nbeen, and continue to be, various legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available \\nto online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as well as to impose new obligations on online \\nplatforms with respect to commerce listings, user content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our \\ncurrent protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur \\nsignificant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We could also face \\nfines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-imposed remedies as a result \\nof content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted in the past, and may result in \\nthe future, in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement \\ncooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin \\nAmerica are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing potentially significant penalties, including fines, \\n38', \"service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, \\nwe have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in \\nRussia and Turkey. Content-related legislation also has required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to change our \\nproducts or business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in \\ncertain geographies. For example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations \\nfor copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to make \\nsubstantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European Copyright Directive may \\nalso require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our compliance costs may significantly increase as a result of the \\nDigital Services Act proposed in the European Union, which is expected to take effect in 2023, and other content-related \\nlegislative developments such as online safety bills in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, changes to \\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act or new state or federal content-related legislation may increase our costs or \\nrequire significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth and \\nengagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nPayment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and \\ndifficult to comply with or that could harm our business.\\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase virtual and digital \\ngoods from developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make \\ndonations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the \\nUnited States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, \\nmoney transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, \\nconsumer protection, charitable fundraising, trade sanctions, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our \\nPayments products evolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, \\nbanking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To \\nincrease flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain \\npayments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions, which will generally require us \\nto demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our efforts to comply with these laws and \\nregulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In \\nthe event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary \\nfines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of which could \\nhave an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased \\ncosts and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes; \\npotential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third parties; restrictions on the \\ninvestment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We have also \\nlaunched certain payments functionality on WhatsApp and have announced plans to develop digital payments products and \\nservices, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.\\nOur digital payments initiatives subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our \\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results.\\nWe are pursuing digital payments initiatives, such as Novi, a digital wallet that we expect to offer as both a standalone \\napplication and subsequently integrated in other Meta products. These initiatives may use blockchain-based assets, such as \\nthe USDP stablecoin issued by Paxos Trust Company, which is being used in a Novi pilot program in the United States and \\nGuatemala beginning in October 2021. Our future initiatives to support commerce in the metaverse also may use blockchain-\\nbased assets in digital payments. Use of blockchain-based assets in payments are a relatively new and unproven technology, \\nand the laws and regulations surrounding them are uncertain and evolving. These digital payments efforts have drawn \\nsignificant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. We are \\nparticipating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators related to our digital payments initiatives, and \\nadverse government or regulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our \\nreputation and harm our business.\\nAs our digital payments initiatives evolve, we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States \\nand international jurisdictions, including those governing payments, financial services, virtual currency, anti-money \\n39\", \"laundering, counter-terrorism financing, trade sanctions, data protection, tax, consumer protection, and competition. In many \\njurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear, particularly with respect to evolving \\nlaws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments. In addition, Novi has also received state money \\ntransmitter licenses in the United States, with more pending approval, and has other financial services license applications \\npending in certain other countries that would allow us to conduct digital wallet activities in those countries. These licenses, \\nlaws, and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the development of digital \\npayments products and services we offer, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or \\notherwise harm our business.\\nIn addition, market acceptance of digital payments products and services is subject to significant uncertainty. As such, \\nthere can be no assurance that digital payments products and services we offer will be made available in a timely manner, or \\nat all. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based technology, which may adversely affect our ability \\nto successfully develop and market such digital payments products and services. We will also incur increased costs in \\nconnection with these efforts, and our investments may not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our \\nbusiness, reputation, or financial results.\\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our \\nsystems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to \\ndisrupt our ability to provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission \\nof a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our \\ndata or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from users, or information from marketers, \\ncould result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our business \\nand reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as \\nspear phishing attacks), scraping, and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems \\nin the past, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable \\nuser accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, \\nor other objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data \\nand content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving new and \\nemerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks, including from \\nnation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors. Our efforts to address undesirable \\nactivity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the \\nservices we provide, degrade the user experience, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, \\nimpair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we \\nreceive, and to disable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other \\ntechnical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our \\nvendors' information technology systems or offerings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities \\nor technical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce \\nemployees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks continue to \\nevolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have \\ndeveloped systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to disable \\nundesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that \\nsuch measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts \\nwill be successful. The changes in our work environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impact the \\nsecurity of our systems, as well as our ability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly.\\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may \\nreceive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with our products. \\nWe provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us. However, if these third \\nparties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, \\nour data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. \\nWe experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur \\n40\", \"significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and \\nregulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as obligations under our \\nmodified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory \\nactions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data, \\nwhich has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or \\nconsent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may \\nalso result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse \\neffect on our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a \\nvulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens, which were then used to access certain profile information from \\napproximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this cyber-attack became the subject of Irish \\nData Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and \\ncosts, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or \\nadversely affect our business.\\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify additional \\ninstances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy, safety, \\nsecurity, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties, including investigations \\nand audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. As a result of these efforts we have discovered and \\nannounced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of misuse of user data or other \\nundesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or \\ntechnical limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, \\nchallenges related to our personnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the allocation of resources to other \\nprojects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required \\nunder our modified consent order with the FTC, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the \\npast, and may in the future, include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or \\npolicies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising practices, activities \\nthat threaten people's safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or \\nspreading misinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any \\nsuch incidents. Consequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, \\nharm to our reputation and brands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects \\non our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory \\ninquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to \\nenhanced regulatory oversight.\\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or \\nvulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely \\naffect our business.\\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or \\nmaintained internally and/or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal \\nsystems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of \\ndata. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, or \\nvulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our \\nobjectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the \\ncode has been released for external or internal use. For example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-\\nparty cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile \\ninformation from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the \\nsoftware and hardware on which we rely, or human error in using such systems, have in the past led to, and may in the future \\nlead to, outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our \\nproducts to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or \\nenhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our \\nintellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make \\n41\", 'commitments to our users as to how their data will be used within and across our products, and our systems are subject to \\nerrors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, \\nbugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or \\nmitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our \\ncommitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our \\nreputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or \\nother remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be \\ndiminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with \\nour employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade \\nsecret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have \\nfiled various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold a significant \\nnumber of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications \\nfrom third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge \\nproprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, \\neffective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our \\nbusiness. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent \\ninfringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can \\nbe no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our \\nbusiness. In addition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other \\ntechnology we developed available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a \\nresult of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or \\ndisclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation \\nrisk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the \\nvalue of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our \\nproducts, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial \\nresults.\\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that \\nare expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial \\ncondition, or results of operations.\\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and \\ntrade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of \\nintellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own patents and other intellectual \\nproperty rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies. \\nFurthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not \\ncompeted, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-\\npracticing entities.\\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and \\nservices, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual \\nproperty lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of \\npatent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is \\ncostly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable \\nfinal outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or \\nprovisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some \\nor all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if \\nany litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be \\nreversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or \\npay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in \\nviolation of a third party\\'s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our \\noperating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or \\n42', 'practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require \\nsignificant effort and expense, could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user \\nexperience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and \\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution \\nof the disputes and litigation referred to above.\\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our \\nClass A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has \\nranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2021. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on \\nForm 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate \\nsignificantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable segments;\\n• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these\\nprojections;\\n• actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities\\nanalysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\\n• additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with\\nacquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;\\n• investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions,\\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\\n• announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the\\nlevel of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;\\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including\\nour developers and competitors;\\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\\n• the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\\n• media coverage of our business and financial performance;\\n• lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\\n• adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content,\\nprivacy, or other matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\\n• trading activity in our share repurchase program; and\\n• other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive\\nexternal events, or responses to these events.\\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue \\nto affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation \\n43', 'in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data \\nwith third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; \\nand a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021. We may \\nexperience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial \\ncosts, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings \\nto finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do not expect to \\ndeclare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in \\nour Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of \\nconcentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or \\npreclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. \\nStockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, including certain of our executive officers, employees, and directors \\nand their affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the \\nten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock \\ncollectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all \\nmatters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of \\nall outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability \\nto influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common \\nstock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The \\nconversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative \\nvoting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, \\nMr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he \\ncould, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise \\nharm our stock price.\\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we \\nare not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation \\ncommittee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of \\ndirectors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. Accordingly, \\nshould the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not \\nhave the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for \\nNasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some \\ninvestors or otherwise harm our stock price.\\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy \\ncontest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may \\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an \\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of \\ncontrol would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws \\ncontain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\\n• until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our\\n44', 'company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\\n• we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control\\nthe outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the\\nshares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\\npower of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval\\nof two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\\npower of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of\\ndirectors and not by stockholders;\\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\\npower of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered\\nthree-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\\n• when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting\\npower of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not\\nby written consent;\\n• only our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to\\ncall a special meeting of stockholders;\\n• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters\\nbefore an annual meeting of stockholders;\\n• our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and\\nshares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval; and\\n• certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\\n45', \"Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments \\nNone.\\nItem 2. Properties\\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California. As of December 31, 2021, we owned and leased \\napproximately 10 million square feet of office and building space for our corporate headquarters and in the surrounding areas, \\nand approximately 69 acres of land to be developed to accommodate anticipated future growth.\\nIn addition, we have offices in more than 80 cities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia \\nPacific, and Latin America. We also own 18 data centers globally.\\nWe believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs.\\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal \\ncourts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities \\nlaws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as \\nthe misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and \\nseeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in \\nfederal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in \\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These \\ntwo actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California \\nwith the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, \\n2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. \\nOn November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On \\nAugust 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On \\nOctober 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On December 20, \\n2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, with prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the \\nplaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well \\nas the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission \\n(FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We \\nentered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required \\nus to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and \\noversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and \\ncould subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the \\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative \\naction was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty \\nand related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On \\nJuly 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, \\nasserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in \\nconnection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second \\namended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are \\nwithout merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the \\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to \\ninquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory \\ncompliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily \\nconcluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of European user data does not \\nachieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to \\nthe United States should therefore be suspended. Meta Platforms Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry \\nin a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020. On May 14, 2021, the court rejected Meta \\nPlatforms Ireland's procedural challenges, and the inquiry subsequently recommenced. We believe a final decision in this \\n46\", 'inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Our \\nbusiness is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data \\nprotection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters\" in this Annual Report on \\nForm 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our \\nbusiness practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\\nIn addition, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by \\ncompetition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits \\nconcern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital \\nadvertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by \\nthe FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint \\nagainst us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and \\nunfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman \\nAct, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our \\nplatform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. \\nDepartment of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of \\nGuam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \\nalleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring \\nInstagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also \\nalleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and \\nattorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company\\'s alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other \\nequitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our \\nmotions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC\\'s complaint with leave to \\namend and dismissing the attorneys general\\'s case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of \\nappeal of the order dismissing their case. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, \\nwe filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC\\'s \\namended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States \\nagainst us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other \\nalleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and unspecified injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on \\nbehalf of certain advertisers and users were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On \\nJanuary 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. We believe \\nthese lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. The result of such litigation, investigations or \\ninquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, \\ndivert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies \\nthat adversely affect our business.\\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure \\npractices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating \\nto a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among other things, our \\nalgorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable \\nactivity on our platform, and user well-being . Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed in \\nfederal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in \\nconnection with the same matters. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory \\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our \\nlegal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user information in \\nparticular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us. We \\nbelieve we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we \\nintend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and \\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we may in the future be subject to additional legal \\nproceedings and disputes.\\nItem 4.

Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences \\ninclude those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk \\nFactors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \\n\"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash \\nflow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled \" —\\nRevenue —Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue \\nfor the full year 2021 using 2020 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. \\nFor a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled \" —Liquidity and Capital Resources\\n—Free Cash Flow.\"\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, \\nfinancial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non ‑GAAP \\nfinancial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of \\nrevenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned \\nthat the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these \\nnon-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our \\nbusiness, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business \\nperformance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2021 Results \\nOur key community metrics and financial results for 2021 are as follows:\\nFamily of Apps metrics:\\n• Family daily active people (DAP) was 2.82 billion on average for December 2021, an increase of 8% year-over-year.\\n• Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.59 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\\n• Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.93 billion on average for December 2021, an increase of 5% year-over-\\nyear.\\n• Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.91 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 4% year-over-year.\\n• Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 10% year-over-year in 2021, and the average price\\nper ad increased by 24% year-over-year in 2021.\\n50', \"Consolidated and segment results:\\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2021,  we report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of \\nApps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

All of our products,\\nincluding our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\\nIn 2021, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to \\nconnect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective. We also continued to invest \\nbased on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our \\ncompany, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today \\nand set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of \\nbusinesses that rely on our services to grow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing \\nand the role our services play in the world.\\nOur advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 was adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a \\nresult of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the iOS operating system. We expect \\nthat future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by these and other limitations on our ad \\ntargeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating \\nsystems and browsers. \\nOur business and results of operations have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventative \\nmeasures implemented by authorities from time to time to help limit the spread of the illness, which have caused, and are \\ncontinuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions. Beginning in the first quarter \\nof 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions \\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen these pandemic-related trends subside, particularly in \\ncertain developed markets. We are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any \\ncertainty and these trends may continue to be subject to volatility.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also had a varied impact on the demand for and pricing of our ads from period to period. \\nWhile we experienced a reduction in demand and a related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic, we believe the \\npandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, particularly during the second half \\nof 2020, and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of this trend. More recently, we believe this \\ngrowth has moderated in many regions, which to some extent adversely affected our advertising revenue growth in the \\nsecond half of 2021. We may experience reduced advertising demand and related declines in pricing in future periods to the \\nextent this trend continues, which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. However, the impact of the \\n51\", \"pandemic on user growth and engagement, the demand for and pricing of our advertising services, as well as on our overall \\nresults of operations, remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future.\\nUser growth and engagement were also impacted by a number of other factors in the second half of 2021. For \\nexample, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, and in \\nresponse to competitive pressures, we have introduced new features such as Reels, which is growing in usage but is not \\ncurrently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. We also saw a deceleration in our community growth \\nrates as the size of our community continued to increase. In addition, we experienced year-over-year declines in ad \\nimpressions delivered in the United States & Canada region. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue growth in \\nthe second half of 2021 and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue growth in the foreseeable future. Other \\nglobal and regional business and macroeconomic conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact \\non our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue growth.\\nWe anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office \\nfacilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, including in our Reality Labs initiatives, will continue to \\ndrive expense growth in 2022. We expect 2022  capital expenditures to be in the range of $29-34 billion and total expenses to \\nbe in the range of $90-95 billion. In 2022, we also expect that our year-over-year total expense growth rates may significantly \\nexceed our year-over-year revenue growth rates, which would adversely affect our operating margin and profitability.\\n52\", 'Trends in Our Family Metrics\\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include \\nusers on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities \\non our Family products. \\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of \\nads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and \\ncapital expenditures.

We define ARPU as our total \\nrevenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the \\nbeginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation \\nonly includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue \\nfrom users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who \\nare Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. See \"Average Revenue Per Person \\n(ARPP)\" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The geography of our users affects \\nour revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our \\nrevenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and \\nmaturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2021 in the United States & Canada region \\nwas more than 12 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.\\nRevenue\\nWorldwide\\n(in\\t$\\tmillions,\\texcept\\tARPU)\\n21,082\\n17,73718,68721,47028,07226,17129,07729,01033,671\\n$20,736$17,440 $18,321$21,221$27,187 $25,439$28,580 $28,276$32,639 $346\\n$297$366$249$885$732$497 $734$1,032\\nDec\\t31\\n2019Mar\\t31\\n2020Jun\\t30\\n2020Sep\\t30\\n2020Dec\\t31\\n2020Mar\\t31\\n2021Jun\\t30\\n2021Sep\\t30\\n2021Dec\\t31\\n202107,00014,00021,00028,00035,000\\nARPU: $8.52\\t $6.95\\t $7.05\\t $7.89\\t\\t$10.14\\t $9.27\\t\\t$10.12\\t \\t$10.00\\t \\t$11.57\\t\\nRevenue\\nUS\\t&\\tCanada\\n(in\\t$\\tmillions,\\texcept\\tARPU)\\n10,248\\n8,5629,29110,13713,734\\n12,40513,73813,61315,826\\n$10,021$8,379 $9,059$9,988$13,150$11,897$13,366 $13,094$15,062$227\\n$183$232$149$584\\n$508$372 $519$764\\nDec\\t31\\n2019Mar\\t31\\n2020Jun\\t30\\n2020Sep\\t30\\n2020Dec\\t31\\n2020Mar\\t31\\n2021Jun\\t30\\n2021Sep\\t30\\n2021Dec\\t31\\n202103,0006,0009,00012,00015,00018,000\\nRevenue\\nEurope\\n(in\\t$\\tmillions,\\texcept\\tARPU)\\n5,159\\n4,2544,5025,1047,0116,5237,2706,9558,357\\n$5,071$4,171 $4,411$5,051$6,822$6,373$7,205 $6,821$8,174 $88\\n$83$91$53$189$150$65$134$183\\nDec\\t31\\n2019Mar\\t31\\n2020Jun\\t30\\n2020Sep\\t30\\n2020Dec\\t31\\n2020Mar\\t31\\n2021Jun\\t30\\n2021Sep\\t30\\n2021Dec\\t31\\n202102,5005,0007,50010,000\\nARPU: $\\t41.41\\t $\\t34.18\\t $\\t36.49\\t $\\t39.63\\t $\\t53.56\\t $\\t48.03\\t $\\t53.01\\t $\\t52.34\\t $\\t60.57\\t ARPU: $13.21 $10.64 $11.03 $12.41 $16.87 $15.49 $17.23 $\\t16.50\\t $\\t19.68\\t\\nRevenue\\nAsia-Pacific\\n(in\\t$\\tmillions,\\texcept\\tARPU)\\n3,6653,2573,3414,2304,7934,7895,1905,4616,244\\n$3,642$3,236 $3,312$4,202$4,703 $4,735$5,152 $5,398$6,183$23$21 $29$28$90 $54$38$63$61\\nDec\\t31\\n2019Mar\\t31\\n2020Jun\\t30\\n2020Sep\\t30\\n2020Dec\\t31\\n2020Mar\\t31\\n2021Jun\\t30\\n2021Sep\\t30\\n2021Dec\\t31\\n202102,0004,0006,0008,000\\nRevenue\\nRest\\tof\\tWorld\\n(in\\t$\\tmillions,\\texcept\\tARPU)\\n2,010\\n1,6641,5531,9992,5342,4542,8792,9813,244\\n$2,002$1,654 $1,539$1,980$2,512 $2,434$2,857 $2,963 $3,220 $8\\n$10$14$19$22 $20$22 $18$24\\nDec\\t31\\n2019Mar\\t31\\n2020Jun\\t30\\n2020Sep\\t30\\n2020Dec\\t31\\n2020Mar\\t31\\n2021Jun\\t30\\n2021Sep\\t30\\n2021Dec\\t31\\n202101,0002,0003,0004,0005,000\\nARPU: $3.57 $3.06 $2.99 $3.67 $4.05 $3.94 $4.16 $4.30 $4.89 ARPU: $2.48 $1.99 $1.78 $2.22 $2.77 $2.64 $3.05 $3.14 $3.43\\nNote: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which \\nconsists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.\\n58', 'Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users \\nwhen they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — \\nRevenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" where revenue is \\ngeographically apportioned based on the addresses of our custom ers. \\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2021, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $40.96, \\nan increase of 28% from 2020. For 2021, ARPU increased by 40% in Rest of World, 35% in Europe, 31% in the United \\nStates & Canada, and 26% in Asia ‑Pacific, as compared with 2020. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies \\nwith relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia ‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be \\nprimarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to \\nincrease at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each \\ngeographic region.\\n59', 'Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these \\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, \\nliabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and \\nassumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the \\ncircumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels \\nof subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, \\nand the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the \\nassumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income \\ntaxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and \\nequipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our \\nconsolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For \\nfurther information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\nin the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nGross vs. Net in Revenue Recognition\\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether \\nwe are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, \\nwe consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as \\nother indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. \\nThe assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of \\nrevenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income. \\nValuation of Equity Investments\\nFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, \\ndetermining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require \\njudgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, \\ndistribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such \\nas, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. In \\naddition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our \\ninvestee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value \\nadjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For \\nequity investments, we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering \\nevents for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee\\'s financial \\ncondition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; \\noperational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of \\nimpairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach \\nand recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying \\nvalue. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding \\nperiod, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is \\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating \\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. \\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax \\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These \\nuncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate \\n60', 'arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development tax \\ncredits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities \\nsupporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax \\npositions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will \\nnot be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance \\nwhen facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that \\nthe final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for \\nincome taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition \\nand operating results.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise \\nin the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate \\namounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, \\nand we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for \\ncomplying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other \\nauthorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With \\nrespect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a \\nliability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If \\nwe determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably \\nestimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent \\nmaterial.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been \\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions \\nand changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, \\nregulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to \\ndetermine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has \\nchanged for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these \\nestimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where \\nwe operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing \\ndamages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted \\nagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union \\nprivacy regulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to \\nsignificant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our \\nestimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters. \\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or \\nprobable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more \\nof these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management\\'s estimates of losses, our results of operations \\nand financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and \\nestimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14 — Income \\nTaxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements \\nand Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional \\ninformation regarding these contingencies.\\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated Useful \\nLives \\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible \\nassets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values \\nof these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the \\nbusiness combination. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with \\nrespect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated \\nreplacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade \\nnames from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management\\'s estimates of fair value are based \\n61', 'upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual \\nresults may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our \\namortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-\\nlived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one \\nyear from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the \\ncorresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded \\nto earnings.\\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in \\ncircumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two \\nreporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been \\nidentified.\\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible \\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The \\nevaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of \\nother assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future \\nundiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates \\nthat the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such \\nassets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.\\nThe useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are \\ndetermined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated \\nuseful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances, but \\nmay differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, \\nchanges in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption \\nfor any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the \\nrevised estimated useful life. \\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the \\nestimated average useful lives of our server and network assets category. The effect of the 2021 change was a reduction in \\ndepreciation expense of $620 million and an increase in net income of $516 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. The impact \\nfrom the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as of the effective dates of the changes and \\napplying the revised useful lives prospectively. See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the \\naccompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding changes in the estimated \\nuseful lives of our property and equipment.\\n62', 'Components of Results of Operations\\nRevenue \\nFamily of Apps (FoA)\\nAdvertising . We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by \\ndisplaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. \\nMarketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advert ising agencies or resellers, based on the \\nnumber of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. \\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are \\ndelivered.

The increase was mostly driven by an \\nincrease in advertising revenue.\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising revenue in 2021 increased $30.76 billion, or 37%, compared to 2020 as a result of increases in both the \\naverage price per ad and the number of ads delivered. In 2021, the average price per ad increased by 24%, as compared with a \\ndecrease of approximately 10% in 2020. The increase in average price per ad in 2021 was mainly caused by a recovery from \\ndeclines in advertising demand in the first two quarters of 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, \\noverall advertising demand increased, as compared to 2020, across our ad products and in all regions in part due to the \\ncontinued growth of online commerce. In 2021, the number of ads delivered increased by 10%, as compared with an \\napproximate 34% increase in 2020. The increase in the ads delivered in 2021 was driven by increases in users and the number \\nand frequency of ads displayed across our products. We anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be driven by a \\ncombination of price and the number of ads delivered. \\n65', \"Reality Labs\\nRL revenue increased $1.14 billion, or 100%, from 2020 to 2021, and $638 million, or 127%, from 2019 to 2020. The \\nincreases in both periods were mostly driven by increases in the volume of our consumer hardware products sold.\\nRevenue Seasonality and Customer Concentration\\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. \\nWe believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, \\nwhich generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth \\nand subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 16%, 31%, and 19% between the third and fourth \\nquarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019 declined \\n7%, 16%, and 11% compared to the fourth quarters of 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We note the decline in total \\nrevenue in the first quarter of 2020 was exacerbated by the non-seasonal impact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue \\nThe general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2021 compared to the \\nsame period in 2020 had a favorable impact on revenue.

As a result, we recorded a total of $1.07 billion \\nincome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020. \\nEffective Tax Rate Items . Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following \\nitems and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects \\nfrom share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax \\ncontingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.\\nThe accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the \\ndifference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the \\nstock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 28, 2022 price, and \\nabsent U.S. tax legislation changes and other one-time events, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2022 to be \\nsimilar to the effective tax rate for the full year 2021. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and \\namortization of research and development expenses starting in 2022, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax \\nAct). The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash tax liabilities but also decreases our effective tax rate due \\nto increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization requirement is deferred, our \\neffective tax rate in 2022 could be a few percentage points higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities \\ncould be several billion dollars lower.\\nIntegrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that \\nhave the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective \\ntax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon \\nthe specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in \\nsubsequent periods.\\nSee Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial \\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income tax \\ncontingencies.\\n69', 'Liquidity and Capital Resources\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from \\noperations. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in \\nmoney market funds, investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade \\ncorporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $48.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, a \\ndecrease of $13.96 billion from December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to $44.54 billion for repurchases of our \\nClass A common stock, $19.24 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, and \\n$5.51 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock units (RSU) awards, offset by \\n$57.68 billion of cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.\\nCash paid for income taxes was $8.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our \\nfederal net operating loss carryforward was $10.61 billion and our federal tax credit carryforward was $527 million. We \\nanticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses and credits within the next two years. \\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in \\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired 136 million shares of \\nour Class A common stock for $44.81 billion. As of December 31, 2021, $38.79 billion remained available and authorized for \\nrepurchases. \\nAs of December 31, 2021, $10.61 billion of the $48.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities \\nwas held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and \\neliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for \\ndistribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.\\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our \\noperational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the \\nforeseeable future.\\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2020 2019\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 57,683 $ 38,747 $ 36,314 \\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (7,570) $ (30,059) $ (19,864) \\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (50,728) $ (10,292) $ (7,299) \\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\\nCash provided by operating activities during 2021 mostly consisted of $39.37 billion net income adjusted for certain \\nnon-cash items, including $9.16 billion of share-based compensation expense and $7.97 billion of depreciation and \\namortization. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily  due to higher \\nnet income as adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense and deferred income taxes, \\npartially offset by changes in working capital.\\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nCash used in investing activities during 2021 primarily consisted of $18.57 billion of purchases of property and \\nequipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure offset by \\n$12.18 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during \\n2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to decreases in net purchases of marketable securities and equity investments, \\npartially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $29 billion to $34 billion in 2022.\\n70', 'Cash Used in Financing Activities\\nCash used in financing activities during 2021 mostly consisted of $44.54 billion for repurchases of our Class A \\ncommon stock and $5.51 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs. The increase in cash used in financing \\nactivities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to the increase in repurchases of our Class A common stock.\\nFree Cash Flow \\nIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as \\na non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources. \\nWe define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and equipment and principal \\npayments on finance leases.\\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides \\nuseful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments \\nrequired to maintain and grow our business. \\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental \\ninformation to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with our senior \\nmanagement and board of directors.\\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of \\nother GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our \\nresidual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:\\n• FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\\n• other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness\\nas comparative measures.\\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of \\nsuch limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to the most \\ndirectly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.\\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating \\nactivities (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2020 2019\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 57,683 $ 38,747 $ 36,314 \\nLess: Purchases of property and equipment (18,567) (15,115) (15,102) \\nLess: Principal payments on finance leases (677) (604) (552) \\nFree cash flow $ 38,439 $ 23,028 $ 20,660 \\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a \\nmaterial current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital \\nresources.\\n71', 'Contractual Obligations\\nOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments. \\nOur operating lease obligations mostly include among others, certain of our offices, data centers, colocations and land.

These agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either \\nvolume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately \\n$8.06 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual \\nvolume purchased.\\nOur other liabilities also include $4.40 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021. Due to \\nuncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we \\nare unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a \\nresult, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.\\nContingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We \\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be \\nreasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss \\ncan be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the \\nextent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters \\nare inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of \\nthese estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, \\nfinancial position, and cash flows.\\nSee Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated \\nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal \\nProceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \\nFor further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial \\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n72', 'Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity \\ninvestment risk.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the \\nU.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, \\nhave in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or \\nlosses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional \\ncurrency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, \\nderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict \\nthe effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency losses of $140 million, $129 million, \\nand $105 million were recognized in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, as interest and other income, net in our consolidated \\nstatements of income. \\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash \\nequivalents and marketable securities.\\nOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money \\nmarket funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. \\nOur investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes \\nin U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market \\nvalue of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of \\n$714 million and $794 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and \\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if \\nwe sold the investments prior to maturity.\\nEquity Investment Risk\\nOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on the \\ncarrying value of our holdings. We continually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies. \\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable \\nfair values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less \\nany impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments \\nof the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering \\nevents for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee\\'s financial \\ncondition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant \\nevents and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily \\navailable market data and observable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including \\nrecent and ongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could \\nresult in a material impairment charge on our equity investments. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method \\nwere immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Our total equity investments had a carrying value of \\n$6.78 billion and $6.23 billion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, \\nNote 5 — Equity Investments, and Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements \\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" contained in \\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n73', \"Item 8.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

However, for certain other matters, \\nthe Company discloses that the amount of such losses or a range of possible losses cannot be \\nreasonably estimated at this time.\\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these loss contingencies was especially \\nchallenging due to the significant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments of the \\nlikelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potential amount or range of such losses.\\nHow We Addressed \\nthe Matter in Our \\nAuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls \\nover the identification and evaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the Company's \\nassessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized and their ability to reasonably estimate the \\npotential range of possible losses. \\nTo test the Company's assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss, whether the loss was \\nreasonably estimable, and the conclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses, \\nincluding when the Company believes it cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, we read the \\nminutes or a summary of the meetings of the committees of the board of directors, read the \\nproceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and investigations, or summaries as we \\ndeemed appropriate, requested and received internal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, \\nmet with internal and external legal counsel to discuss the nature of the various matters, and obtained \\nrepresentations from management. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures \\nincluded in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\\n76\", \"Uncertain Tax Positions\\nDescription of the \\nMatterAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has received certain \\nnotices from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the \\nCompany's foreign subsidiaries for certain periods examined. The IRS has stated that it will also \\napply its position to tax years subsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its position, it \\ncould result in an additional federal tax liability, plus interest and any penalties asserted. The \\nCompany uses judgment to (1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are more-likely-\\nthan-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\\nAuditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these uncertain tax positions was \\nespecially challenging due to the significant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of \\ntechnical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on interpretations of tax laws and \\nlegal rulings.\\nHow We Addressed \\nthe Matter in Our \\nAuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls \\nover the Company's process to assess the technical merits of tax positions related to these transfer \\npricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax positions. \\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for these positions, we involved our \\ntax professionals to assist with our assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax positions. \\nThis included assessing the Company's correspondence with the relevant tax authorities, evaluating \\nincome tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the Company, and requesting and \\nreceiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We also used our knowledge of, and \\nexperience with, the application of international and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax \\nauthorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax positions. We analyzed the Company's \\nassumptions and data used to determine the amount of the federal tax liability recognized and tested \\nthe mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and calculations. We also evaluated the \\nappropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements \\nin relation to these matters.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\\nRedwood City, California \\nFebruary 2, 2022 \\n77\", \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.\\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria \\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit.

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to \\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \\nRedwood City, California \\nFebruary 2, 2022\\n78\", \"META PLATFORMS, INC. \\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \\n(In

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nOrganization  and Description of Business \\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. In October 2021, we changed our corporate name from Facebook, \\nInc. to Meta Platforms, Inc. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. \\nAll of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\\nWe report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The \\nsegment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer \\n(CEO), reviews and manages the business. W e generate substantially  all of our revenue from advertising.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \\n(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have \\ncontrolling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All \\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments \\nthat affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the \\nbasis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other \\nsources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are \\nreasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not \\nlimited to, those related to revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation \\nof long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful \\nlives, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, credit losses of accounts receivable, fair value of financial \\ninstruments, and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events and expectations about \\nactions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\nIn connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the \\nestimated average useful lives of selected cohorts of servers and network assets from three years to four years in prior years \\nas well as in 2021 as a result of longer refresh cycles in our data centers. Prior year changes individually or in aggregate did \\nnot have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The effect of the 2021 changes was a reduction in \\ndepreciation expense of $620 million and an increase in net income of $516 million, or $0.18 per diluted share for the year \\nended December 31, 2021. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as \\nof the effective dates of the changes and applying the revised estimated useful lives prospectively.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount \\nthat reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. \\nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\\n• identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\\n• identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\\n• determination of the transaction price;\\n• allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\\n• recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\\n85\", 'Revenue excludes sales and usage ‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass ‑through \\nagent.\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party \\naffiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with \\nadvertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken \\nby our users.\\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are \\ndelivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of \\naction-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising \\nrevenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is \\nevidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. For revenue \\ngenerated from arrangements that involve third-party publishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and \\nfor those advertising revenue arrangements where we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and \\ncertain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration \\nwhen estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts \\nexpected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable \\nconsideration.\\nReality Labs Revenue\\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, Facebook  Portal,  and \\nwearables , and related software and content.  Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products  is transferred to \\ncustomers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to \\nin exchange for the products.\\nOther Revenue\\nOther revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure  and revenue from \\nvarious other sources.\\nDeferred Revenue and Deposits\\nDeferred revenue and deposits mostly consists of billings and payments we receive from marketers in advance of \\nrevenue recognition, revenue not yet recognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various RL products. \\nDeposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarily use these balances to make purchases in games \\non our platform. Once the unused balance is utilized by a user, the majority of this amount would then be payable to the \\ndeveloper and the balance would be recognized as revenue. The increase in the deferred revenue and deposits balance for the \\nyear ended December 31, 2021 was driven by cash payments from customers in advance of satisfying our performance \\nobligations in RL sales and advertising revenue, offset by revenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue \\nbalance at the beginning of the period.\\nOur payment terms vary by the products or services offered. The term between billings and when payment is due is not \\nsignificant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are \\ndelivered to the customer.\\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded \\nwithin marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\\n86', \"We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length \\nof one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for \\nservices performed.\\nCost of Revenue\\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These \\ninclude expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from \\nservers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based \\ncompensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs \\nassociated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing \\ncustomer transactions; RL cost of products sold; and content costs.\\nContent Costs\\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to \\nincrease engagement on the platform. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available \\nfor viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not \\nmaterial to date.\\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are \\nincluded in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be \\nmarketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is \\ntypically reached shortly before the release of such products.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and \\napplications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the \\npreliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to \\nperform the function intended.\\nDevelopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\\nShare-based Compensation\\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to \\nemployees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. \\nShare-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period. \\nWe account for forfeitures as they occur.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is \\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating \\nuncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using \\nthe asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected \\nfuture consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as \\nfor loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to \\napply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We \\nrecognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.\\n87\", \"We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than \\nnot to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, \\nexpectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the \\nneed for a valuation allowance. \\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax \\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These \\nuncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate \\narms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an \\nassessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will \\nbe sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and \\npenalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make \\nadjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, \\nsuch as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is \\ndifferent from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such \\ndetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. \\nAdvertising Expense\\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated \\nstatements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.99 billion, $2.26 billion, and $1.57 billion for the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of \\n90 days or less from the date of purchase.\\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency \\nsecurities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale (AFS) \\ninvestments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current operations. Our AFS \\ninvestments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated \\nother comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of \\nestimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. \\nAllowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a charge in interest and other income, net on our \\nconsolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other \\ncomprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. The amounts of credit losses recorded for the years ended December 31, \\n2021 and 2020 were not material. There was no impairment charge for any unrealized losses in 2019. We determine realized \\ngains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and include such gains or losses in interest \\nand other income, net on the consolidated statements of income.\\nWe also maintain a multi-currency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a third-party bank provider. \\nActual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. We classify \\nthe overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. \\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the \\nconsolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions.\\nEquity Investments  \\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable \\nfair values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less \\nany impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the \\nsame issuer as of the respective transaction dates. The change in carrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other \\nincome, net on our consolidated statements of income. We periodically review our equity investments for impairment. If \\n88\", \"indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we will write down the \\ninvestment to fair value. \\nIn addition, we also held equity investments accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of \\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. \\nFair Value Measurements\\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are \\nrecognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that \\nwould be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at \\nthe measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be \\nrecorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-\\nbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks \\ninherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following \\nhierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the \\nhierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices \\nfor identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by \\nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market \\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy \\nbecause their fair value is derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable \\nmarket inputs.\\nOur equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring \\nbasis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective equity \\ninvestment would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a \\ncombination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, \\nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold. \\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential \\nuncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and \\nallowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of \\nthe accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable \\nforecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected \\ncredit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. As of \\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowances for accounts receivable were immaterial. \\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, which are amortized, are stated at cost \\nless accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the \\nassets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\\n89\", 'The estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use assets are \\ndescribed below: \\nProperty and Equipment  Useful Life/ Amortization period\\nServers and network assets Four years\\nBuildings 25 to 30 years\\nEquipment and other One to 25 years\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets Three to 20 years\\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or \\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the \\ncarrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset\\'s fair value is less than the carrying \\namount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the years \\npresented. \\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially \\nrecognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful lives represents \\nthe best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due \\nto changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and \\ntechnological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying \\namount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. See \\nsection \"Use of Estimates\" above for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and \\nnetwork assets.\\nServers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support \\nproduction traffic. Land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in progress is \\nrelated to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their \\nintended use.\\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost \\nand related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such sale or \\ndisposal is reflected in income from operations.\\nLease Obligations\\nWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data centers, land, colocations, network infrastructure, and \\nother equipment. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We  determine if an arrangement is a lease at \\ninception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for \\nmaintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and \\naccount for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent \\nescalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. Such variable lease costs are expensed as \\nincurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio \\napproach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities.\\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the \\nconsolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and \\nincludes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.  \\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise \\nsuch options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-\\nbased, and market-based factors.\\n90', 'As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information \\navailable at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is a \\nhypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.\\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease \\nliabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, \\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on \\na straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise \\nin the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate \\namounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, \\nand we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for \\ncomplying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other \\nauthorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With \\nrespect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a \\nliability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If \\nwe determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably \\nestimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent \\nmaterial. \\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been \\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions \\nand changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, \\nregulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to \\ndetermine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has \\nchanged for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these \\nestimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where \\nwe operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing \\ndamages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted \\nagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union \\nprivacy regulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions can be finalized, which can \\nlead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our \\nestimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters. \\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible \\nassets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values \\nof these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the \\nbusiness combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization \\nexpense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible \\nassets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the \\nacquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to \\ngoodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-\\nrelated expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our \\nreporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we \\nreassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level \\n91', \"annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a \\nreporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of \\nDecember 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or \\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these intangible \\nassets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other \\nassets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future \\nundiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates \\nthat the carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets is not recoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying \\namount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the years \\npresented.\\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. \\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have \\na finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively \\nover its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of finite-lived intangible \\nassets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over \\nthe revised estimated useful life.\\nForeign Currency\\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial \\nstatements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates \\nof exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive \\nincome (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2021, we had a cumulative translation loss, net of \\ntax of $677 million and as of December 31, 2020, we had a cumulative translation gain, net of tax of $439 million. \\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional \\ncurrency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income, net on our consolidated statements of \\nincome. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $140 million, $129 million, and $105 million for the \\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\\nCredit Risk and Concentration\\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash \\nequivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The majority of cash equivalents consists of \\nmoney market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable securities consist of \\ninvestments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt \\nsecurities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The \\namount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 was not material.\\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different \\nindustries and countries. We generated 41%, 42%, and 43% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, \\nand 2019, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with the majority of revenue outside of the \\nUnited States coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Thailand.\\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an \\nallowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our operating results \\nand financial position could be adversely affected.\\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\\n92\", \"Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-01, Investments—Equity Securities \\n(Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU \\n2020-01), which clarifies the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting for equity \\nmethod investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815.

The new standard was effective for us beginning \\nJanuary 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our \\nconsolidated financial statements. \\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract \\nAssets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which clarifies that an acquirer of a business \\nshould recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with \\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . This guidance \\nwill be effective for us in the first quarter of 2023 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We are currently \\nevaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10,  Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business \\nEntities about Government Assistance (ASU 2021-10), which improves the transparency of government assistance received \\nby most business entities by requiring the disclosure of: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2) the accounting \\nfor such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity's financial statements.

Earnings per Share\\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the \\nliquidation and dividend rights for both Class A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings are \\nallocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Basic EPS is \\ncomputed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock \\noutstanding.\\nFor the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including \\nawards under our equity compensation plans.\\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B \\ncommon stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of \\nthose shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the resulting net income by the weighted-\\naverage number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\\nRSUs with anti-dilutive effect were excluded from the EPS calculation and they were not material for the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation \\nand dividend rights.\\n94', 'The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as \\nfollows (in millions, except per share amounts):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2020 2019\\nClass\\nAClass\\nBClass\\nAClass\\nBClass\\nAClass\\nB \\nBasic EPS:\\nNumerator\\nNet income $ 33,328 $ 6,042 $ 24,607 $ 4,539 $ 15,569 $ 2,916 \\nDenominator\\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share 2,383 432 2,407 444 2,404 450 \\nBasic EPS $ 13.99 $ 13.99 $ 10.22 $ 10.22 $ 6.48 $ 6.48 \\nDiluted EPS:\\nNumerator\\nNet income $ 33,328 $ 6,042 $ 24,607 $ 4,539 $ 15,569 $ 2,916 \\nReallocation of net income as a result of conversion of \\nClass B to Class A common stock 6,042 — 4,539 — 2,916 — \\nReallocation of net income to Class B common stock — (93) — (58) — (18) \\nNet income for diluted EPS $ 39,370 $ 5,949 $ 29,146 $ 4,481 $ 18,485 $ 2,898 \\nDenominator\\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share 2,383 432 2,407 444 2,404 450 \\nConversion of Class B to Class A common stock 432 — 444 — 450 — \\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive RSUs 44 — 37 — 22 1 \\nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 2,859 432 2,888 444 2,876 451 \\nDiluted EPS $ 13.77 $ 13.77 $ 10.09 $ 10.09 $ 6.43 $ 6.43 \\n95', 'Note 4.

Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in \\nfederal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in \\nconnection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These \\ntwo actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California \\nwith the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, \\n2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. \\nOn November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On \\nAugust 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On \\nOctober 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On December 20, \\n2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, with prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the \\nplaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well \\nas the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission \\n(FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We \\nentered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among \\nother matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the \\neffectiveness of the modified consent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other \\njurisdictions remain ongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against \\ncertain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform \\nand user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended \\nderivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims \\nagainst certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data \\npractices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder \\nderivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the \\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to \\ninquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory \\ncompliance. The GDPR is still a relatively new law and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by \\nother European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in \\nthe final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the \\nimposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously \\ndefending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries \\nand investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to \\nthese matters could be material in the aggregate.\\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure \\npractices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating \\nto a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among other things, our \\nalgorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable \\nactivity on our platform, and user well-being. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed in \\nfederal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in \\nconnection with the same matters. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory \\nagencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our \\nlegal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user information in \\nparticular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us. We \\nbelieve we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we \\nintend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties. \\n102\", \"With respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular \\nbasis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we \\nbelieve there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. With respect to the matters \\ndescribed above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss, such losses or range of \\npossible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that \\nthey may be material in the aggregate.\\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and \\ninvestigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we are subject to various litigation and government \\ninquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other \\njurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of \\nsocial networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our \\nacquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our \\ncompany. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \\nalleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the \\nFederal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp \\nin 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we \\nbecame the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, \\n2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us in \\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of \\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining \\nconditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring \\nInstagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our \\ncompany's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of \\nInstagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and \\nattorneys general, dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without \\nprejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. On August 19, \\n2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On \\nJanuary 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have \\nalso been filed in state and federal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes \\nof action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and \\nunspecified injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users were consolidated in the \\nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, \\nour motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending \\nthem. \\nAdditionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The \\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by \\nregulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or \\nregulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries and \\ninvestigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and \\naccrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe \\nthere is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other matters. We believe that the amount of losses \\nor any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, \\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. \\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is \\nremote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently \\nuncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's \\nestimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any \\nsuch outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14 — Income Taxes.\\n103\", \"Indemnifications\\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify \\ncertain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a \\nbreach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. \\nThese agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In \\naddition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our \\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations. \\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the \\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. \\nHistorically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial \\nstatements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2021, there was not a reasonable possibility we had incurred a material loss \\nwith respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification \\nthrough December 31, 2021.\\nNote 12. Stockholders' Equity\\nCommon Stock\\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of \\nDecember 31, 2021, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of \\nClass B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share.

As of December 31, 2021, we have not declared any \\ndividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of \\nClass B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number \\nof shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. \\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial \\nstatements, unless otherwise noted.\\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were 2,328 million shares of Class A common stock and 413 million shares of Class B \\ncommon stock issued and outstanding.\\nShare Repurchase Program\\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in \\nJanuary 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2020, $8.60 billion remained available and \\nauthorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2021 and October 2021, additional $25.0 billion and $50.0 billion \\nof repurchases were authorized under this program, respectively. In 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired \\n136 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $44.81 billion. As of December 31, 2021, \\n$38.79 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. \\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, \\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased \\nthrough open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to \\nqualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. \\nShare-based Compensation Plans\\nSince 2020, we have maintained one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, \\nwhich was amended in each of June 2016, February 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan). Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the \\nissuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance \\nshares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with the \\nnet settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our stock plan are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.\\n104\", 'As of December 31, 2021, there were 116 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance \\nunder our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number of \\nshares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of the calendar years during the term of the \\nAmended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026 , by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the \\nlesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding \\nDecember 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, \\nour board of directors approved an increase of 20 million shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance effective \\nJanuary 1, 2022.\\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2021: \\nNumber of SharesWeighted-Average \\nGrant Date Fair \\nValue Per Share\\n(in thousands)\\nUnvested at December 31, 2020 96,733 $ 181.88 \\nGranted 59,127 $ 305.40 \\nVested (44,574) $ 198.95 \\nForfeited (12,438) $ 211.58 \\nUnvested at December 31, 2021 98,848 $ 244.32 \\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was \\n$188.73 and $173.66, respectively.

We have federal tax credit \\ncarryforwards of $527 million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and state tax credit carryforwards of \\n$3.18 billion, most of which do not expire.\\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due \\nto the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual \\nlimitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The \\nevents that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than \\n50% over a three ‑year period.\\nThe following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31, \\n2021 2020 2019\\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ beginning of period $ 8,692 $ 7,863 $ 4,678 \\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions 328 356 2,309 \\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions (86) (253) (525) \\nIncreases related to current year tax positions 963 1,045 1,402 \\nDecreases related to settlements of prior year tax positions (90) (319) (1) \\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ end of period $ 9,807 $ 8,692 $ 7,863 \\nThese unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our \\nforeign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for \\n107', \"the uncertainties with our research tax credits. During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to \\nunrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. The amount of \\ninterest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $960 million and $774 million, respectively.\\nIf the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $9.81 billion as of December 31, 2021 were realized in a future \\nperiod, this would result in a tax benefit of $5.70 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.\\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material \\njurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under \\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2019 tax years and by the Irish tax authorities for \\nour 2016 through 2018 tax years. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. Our 2019 and \\nsubsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.\\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our \\nforeign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax \\nyear, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by \\nthe second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court \\nchallenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial \\nan adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March \\n2020 and a second session commenced in October 2021. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS \\nprevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up \\nto approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties \\nasserted. \\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through \\n2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments \\nrelated to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its \\nposition for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million \\nin excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the \\npositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. \\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740,  Income \\nTaxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two \\nNotices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our \\nforeign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe \\nunder the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of \\nDecember 31, 2021, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.\\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the \\nprovision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the \\nresolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross \\nunrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are \\nsubject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized \\ntax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if \\nany, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\\nNote 15.  Segment  and Geographic al Information\\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of \\nApps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL \\nincludes augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content. As of December 31, 2021 , our \\noperating segments are the same as our reportable segments.\\nThe CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using \\ninformation about the operating segment's revenue and income (loss) from operations. The CODM does not evaluate \\noperating segments using asset or liability information.\\n108\", 'Revenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include \\ncertain product development related operating expenses, costs associated with the partnership arrangements, consumer \\nhardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are allocated to segments based on a reasonable \\nallocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the operating segments. Indirect cost \\nof revenue is allocated to our segments based on usage, such as costs related to the operation of our data centers and technical \\ninfrastructure.  Indirect operating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and \\ndevelopment activities, recruiting, and physical security expenses, are mostly  allocated based on headcount .\\nThe following table  sets forth our segment information of revenue and income (loss) from operations (in millions).

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure \\ncontrols and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that \\ninformation we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, \\nsummarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange \\nCommission (SEC), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and \\nCFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as \\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the \\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment, \\nmanagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021 to provide \\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance \\nwith U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with \\nrespect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant \\nto Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2021 that materially affected, or are \\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, \\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only \\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures \\nand internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is \\nrequired to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\\nItem 9B.
