Title: Exploratory Data Analysis and SVM Classification for Stock Price Prediction

Introduction:
This document outlines the steps taken in a data analysis and machine learning pipeline for stock price prediction using a dataset named 'Trading-features.csv'. Techniques such as data preprocessing, time series analysis, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification are employed to gain insights into the data and build a predictive model.

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Null values and duplicate rows are removed, and the data is shuffled.
Date and time columns are formatted appropriately, and the 'last_price' column is converted to numeric format.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

A pair plot is created to visualize the relationships between selected columns ('last_price', 'f1', 'f2', 'f3', 'f4').
Rolling mean and standard deviation are plotted to observe trends and volatility in stock prices over time.
3. Time Series Analysis:

Multiplicative and additive decompositions are applied to the time series data to identify trends, seasonality, and residuals.
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is conducted to assess the stationarity of the 'last_price' time series.
4. Target Variable Creation:

A binary target variable 'target' is created by comparing each 'last_price' with its next value. It indicates whether the next price is higher than the current one.
5. Feature Scaling:

StandardScaler is used to scale the features, a crucial step for SVM models, especially those with non-linear kernels.
6. Train-Test Split and SVM Model:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
A non-linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model with an RBF kernel is trained on the scaled features.
Probability estimates are obtained from the model.
7. Threshold Adjustment and Evaluation:

A threshold is applied to the probability estimates to classify instances.
Model accuracy is evaluated, considering the adjusted threshold.
A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance.
Conclusion:
This analysis and modeling pipeline showcases a comprehensive approach to stock price prediction. EDA provides insights into the dataset, time series analysis aids in understanding temporal patterns, and an SVM model is employed for classification. The document emphasizes the importance of feature scaling and threshold adjustment for enhancing model accuracy.

Note:
This document assumes the availability of necessary libraries, such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels, and the 'Trading-features.csv' dataset. Additionally, it is recommended to further optimize the model, conduct hyperparameter tuning, and consider additional features for more robust predictions in a real-world scenario.
